# Ecommerce-business-analytics-Tableau
A small illustration of how to use Tableau for business analyst-like decision making 

Through this notebook, a couple of facets are illustrated:

A. From the dataset we try to answer some important questions from sales data which include:
i. Which is the most purchased product<br>
ii. Which country purchases most products
iii. Which product is most purchased by country - groups (where we create different groups of countries)
iv. What is the avg. price movement through months (where we extract months from date)
v. What is the trend of avg. price and avg. quantity purchased over the months for each country groups
vi. Which price range has recorded maximum purchases - price ranges across country-groups

B. We display the tableau as part of Kaggle notebook and also link it with Github.

This demonstrates how to think like a business analyst (basic) while dealing with data.
(In real life cases, the data can be present across multiple files. It is necessary to apply queries to assimilate data together for such analysis.
